# AutoImageGenerator
The primary objective is to explore the evolution of AI-generated images by combining the capabilities of the Llava vision model and Stable Diffusion for automatic image generation. This involves an iterative process where images generated by Stable Diffusion are subsequently described using Llava, with the resulting descriptions then used as prompts for generating new images.

A basic prompt is used to generate initial images. Following each generation cycle, the summarize_image function is used to create descriptions of the generated image. This description is then fed back into the generate_image function as a prompt, driving the next iteration of image generation.
